yii2-field-range
=================

A Yii 2 extension that allows you to easily setup ActiveField range fields with Bootstrap 3 addons markup and more. This allows you to setup 
the attributes joined together like a single field with a bootstrap addon separating the two. In addition, it enables you to display the field 
validation error messages as one single block instead of separate validation errors for two fields.

> NOTE: 
- The FieldRange validation routine displays only the first error encountered in validation of either of the attributes.
- To understand setting up your model validation rules for the attributes when using this extension, refer [this wiki](http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/698/model-validation-for-field-ranges-using-yii2-field-range-extension/)


The key features supported by this widget extension are:

- display the two range fields as a single grouped block using Bootstrap 3 addons
- tweak yii active form validation to display validation errors as one single block instead of
  separate error blocks under each field. This allows you to style your field range inputs better 
  for various form layouts. No more misalignment of adjacent fields due to yii validation error messages.
- ability to use any input from yii\helpers or any widget class for rendering the from and to fields.
- enhanced usage with `\kartik\widgets\ActiveField` that allows you to add custom addons to prepend and append to your inputs.
- default support for all widgets under `\kartik\widgets`. Special enhanced support for `\kartik\widgets\DatePicker` 
  to render date ranges.
- ability to use the kartik\datecontrol\DateControl widget which in turn can use any Date or Time widgets.

> NOTE: This extension depends on the [kartik-v/yii2-widgets](https://github.com/kartik-v/yii2-widgets) extension which in turn depends on the 
[yiisoft/yii2-bootstrap](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/tree/master/extensions/bootstrap) extension. Check the 
[composer.json](https://github.com/kartik-v/yii2-field-range/blob/master/composer.json) for this extension's requirements and dependencies. 
Note: Yii 2 framework is still in active development, and until a fully stable Yii2 release, your core yii2-bootstrap packages (and its dependencies) 
may be updated when you install or update this extension. You may need to lock your composer package versions for your specific app, and test 
for extension break if you do not wish to auto update dependencies.
